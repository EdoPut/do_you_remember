Do you remember?
================

Search your history with fine-grained control from the omnibox.

This is the same search provider as the default one but it permits to specify a day in the past with keywords such as `{n}d` (n days), `{n}w` (n weeks) or `{n}m` (n months).

Examples
--------

Search for sites with `news` in the title or url I visited 2 weeks and 4 days ago
```
search 2w 4d news
```

Search for sites with `music` in the title or url I visited 5 months and 2 weeks ago

```
search 2w 5m music
```
